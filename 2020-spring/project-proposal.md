# YACS Project Proposal

## Objectives

**Distribution**
As an open source project, it is key that the code can be easily distributed and tested outside of the RCOS team. For this reason, making deployment and local development easy across multiple environments is key to the success of YACS. Additionally, this would allow us to be pushed to different schools. This semester, cutting out RPI specific code and simplifying the architecture will be the overarching goals.

**Quality**
As an open source project, it is key that others starting the codebase can make sure that the existing code works and new changes do not break previous functionality. This semester, enabling and increasing the amount of test coverage are the overarching goals.

**Usability**
Given this is a project used by both administration and student, it is important that we clearly document and target user-events and user-stories without ambiguity when building new features. This semester, formalizing and starting to utilize the jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) framework is the key goal.

## Key Results

**Distribution**

- Allow starting YACS with a single docker image
- Migrate 100% of Ruby code to Python codebase
- Restart relationship between RPI administration

**Quality**

- Enable unit tests in GitHub Actions
- Enable integration testing with database stubbing
- Achieve 40% test coverage of Python codebase

**Usability**

- Construct JTBD feature request template
- Collect 20 user feature requests using the JTBD template
- Deliver 10 built user features
- Construct JTBD bug template

## Culture
To ensure the future viability of YACS as a project in RCOS is essential we value:

**Learning**

> Iteratively share learnings and decisions during Code Reviews rather than bulk Documentation

**Simplicity**

> Code and architecture is meant to be first understood by humans, and then by machines

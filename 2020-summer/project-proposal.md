# YACS Summer 2020 Project Proposal

## Objectives

**Distribution**
As an open source project, it is key that the code can be easily distributed and tested outside of the RCOS team. For this reason, making deployment and local development easy across multiple environments is key to the success of YACS. Additionally, this would allow us to be pushed to different schools. This semester, the goal is to expand on flexibility of data input. 

**Quality**
As an open source project, it is key that others starting the codebase can make sure that the existing code works and new changes do not break previous functionality. This semester, enabling and increasing the amount of test coverage are the overarching goals.

**Usability**
Given this is a project used by both administration and students, it is important that we clearly document and target user-events and user-stories without ambiguity when building new features. This semester, expanding and enhancing features to facilitate student and administration usage.


## Key Results

**Distribution**

- Allow input of graduation requirements through admin interface
- Additional configurability through admin interface

**Quality**

- Achieve 40% test coverage of Python codebase
- Add integration testing

**Usability**

- Enhance search functionality
- Incorporate graduation requirements into course scheduling

## Culture
To ensure the future viability of YACS as a project in RCOS is essential we value:

**Learning**

> Iteratively share learnings and decisions during Code Reviews rather than bulk Documentation

**Simplicity**

> Code and architecture is meant to be first understood by humans, and then by machines
